# Next.js Project Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for creating new web applications using Next.js and a curated set of modern technologies. It's designed to get you up and running quickly with a solid foundation.

## Included Technologies

This boilerplate comes pre-configured with the following technologies:

*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (v15+ with App Router)
*   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **Styling:**
    *   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (v4) - Utility-first CSS framework.
    *   [Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/) - Comprehensive React component library.
*   **State Management/UI:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) (v19)
*   **Linting/Formatting:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (configured for Next.js)
*   **Fonts:** [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) (via `next/font`)
*   **Potential Integrations (dependencies included, setup required):
    *   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Backend services (Auth, Firestore, Storage, etc.).
    *   [Google Generative AI](https://ai.google.dev/) - For integrating AI capabilities.
    *   [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - For payment processing.
    *   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) / [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - NoSQL database interaction.
    *   [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) - Icon library.
    *   [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - TypeScript-first schema validation.
    *   [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) - Date and time utility.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run a new project based on this boilerplate:

1.  **Clone/Copy the Boilerplate:**
    Start by cloning this repository or copying its files to your new project directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    This project uses environment variables for configuration (e.g., API keys, database connection strings). You'll need to create a `.env` file for your local development.

    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Open the newly created `.env` file in your code editor.
    *   Fill in the placeholder values with your actual credentials and configuration details for services like Firebase, Google AI, Stripe, and MongoDB. **Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.**

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Once dependencies are installed and your `.env` file is configured, you can start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will typically start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  **Open in Browser:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to see your application running.

## Development

*   Modify pages by editing files in the `src/app` directory (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx` for the homepage).
*   Create reusable components in the `src/components` directory (you might need to create this directory if it doesn't exist).
*   Tailwind CSS utility classes can be used directly in your JSX/TSX components.
*   MUI components can be imported from `@mui/material` and used throughout your application. The theme is configured in `src/app/ThemeRegistry.tsx`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts a production server (after building).
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
