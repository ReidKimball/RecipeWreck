# Your Tasks:

Given the attached architecture and tasks files in the chat:
- Read both carefully. There should be no ambiguity about what we’re building.
- Follow tasks .md and complete one task at a time.
- After each task, stop. I’ll test it. If it works, I'll commit to GitHub and will notify you to move to the next.

# Coding Instructions:

- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don’t break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. Supabase/AWS config), tell me clearly
- Only work on one task at a time, when you finish with one, stop and wait for permission to continue
